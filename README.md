# Search Methods Comparision

## Grid Search vs Randon Search vs Bayesian Optimization
Separate codes implementing each of Grid, Random and Bayesian Search along with a single algorithm, applying all three searches on the same datasets, so as to find out which one works the best.

### Requirements 
- All the codes are written in Python.
- Python 3.9 was used. Get all the necessary packages by [clicking here](requirements.txt), then typing the following command in your terminal : 

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
- The original dataset for benchmarking has been taken from PMLB, and can be found [here](https://epistasislab.github.io/pmlb/).
